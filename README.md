# Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers
This project is my solution to Kaggle Playground Series â€“ Season 5, Episode 6 (S5E6), where the task is to predict the top 3 fertilizers for each crop based on soil and environmental features such as temperature, humidity, moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, soil type, and crop type.

The problem is framed as a multi-class ranking challenge, evaluated with MAP@3. My workflow includes data preprocessing, categorical encoding, model training, and extracting probability-based top-3 predictions to generate valid submissions.
